Peptide calculator for reconstituting lyophilized peptides

# PeptiCalc.com – Peptide Dosage Calculator

This project was created for family and friends who needed a clearer, more flexible way to calculate peptide dosages, especially for GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide.

### Why I Built It
This was made for family and friends near me, especially ones taking compounded GLP-1s to assist them in accurate dosing. Most existing calculators only allow reconstitution volumes in milliliters (mL), which can be limiting or unclear when using insulin syringes marked in units. This tool allows users to enter volumes in either mL or units for precision and ease of use.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This calculator is for **informational purposes only** and should **never be used as a substitute for professional medical advice**. Always consult with a licensed physician before using any peptides, including GLP-1s like semaglutide or tirzepatide.

I am not a medical professional, and this tool is not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any condition.
